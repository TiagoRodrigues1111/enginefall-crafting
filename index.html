      <h4>This is the home page for the Enginefall Playtest Crafting Tool. This tool is not made by the 
      official development team, it's a project from a fan of the game and the work they are doing.
      Furthermore, some of the information might became outdated with the progress of the game. 
      For example, the prices of blueprints have changed in the past, and they might change again.
      Feel free to notify me on any potencial changes on the currently provided information. Any 
      help is welcome!
