      <h2>Barrier Breaking Rewards:</h2>
      <p> Breaking the Barriers in the undercarriages between class 3 and 2 
        and between class 2 and 1 is a great way of progressing through the train.
        The first barrier has a health of 10000, whereas the second barrier
        has a health of 15000. Breaking either will give you 3 common isotopes. 
      </p>

      <h2>Base Building:</h2>
      <p> You can build a base on almost all carriages of the train. To do so, you will require a Build tool.
        With that build tool, you can build, upgrade, repair, and disassemble. In the build section, you can make:
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Foundation</li>
        <li>Wall</li>
        <li>Door</li>
        <li>Window</li>
        <li>TODO</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are 3 levels to each structure with different cost and durability:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Level</th>
          <th>Durability</th>
          <th>Cost</th>
          <th>Maintence cost</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>(T1)</td>
          <td>10000</td>
           <td>Metal 5</td>
            <td>TODO</td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
          <td>(T2)</td>
          <td>15000</td>
           <td>Metal 20 Plastic 10</td>
            <td>TODO</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>(T3)</td>
          <td>20000</td>
           <td>Metal 25 Plastic 15 Ceramics 10</td>
            <td>TODO</td>
        </tr>

        
        </tr>
      </table>     
      <p>
        One important information that everyone should know, is that your base will decay if you do not 
        place a Base Core. Base Cores prevent your base from decaying, however they consume resources. 
        Base extenders add +5 to Base Core Chemicals consumption.

        If you use the build tool to repair a structure, it takes TODO plastic. 

        
      </p>
      


      
      <h2>Karma:</h2>
      <p> You recieve karma everytime you destroy a Trash Bag, or donate to the train. For now, karma is 
        useless, with only a cosmetic change to the name of the player.
      </p>
       <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Action</th>
          <th>Karma Reward</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Destroy Trash Bag</td>
          <td>+0.1</td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
          <td>Destroy Furniture</td>
          <td>-0.05</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>etc...</td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>

        
        </tr>
      </table>     

      <h2>Trash Bags:</h2>
      <p> Trash Bags can be found in all of the carriages (except C00), and are one of the few things 
        that give positive karma. There are 4 items that can be found by destroying them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rust Dew</li>
        <li>Mushroom</li>
        <li>Cola</li>
        <li>Roach Nest</li>
      </ul>
      <p> As far as I'm aware, the probability of getting any of them is the same, although the current sample size
        used to reverse engineer the stats is low.
      </p>

      <h2>Recycler Rewards:</h2>
      <p> In the Recycler, you can get back some of the resources used to create most items. Furthermore, you can also
        trade 5 parts for frames and microprocessors: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pistol Frame</li>
        <li>SMG Frame</li>
        <li>Rifle Frame</li>
        <li>Shotgun Frame</li>
        <li>Microprocessor</li>
        <li>Industrial Frame</li>
      </ul>
      <p> As far as I'm aware, the probability of getting any of them is the same, although the current sample size
        used to reverse engineer the stats is low.
      </p>

      <h2>Farming Station:</h2>
      <p> There are two resources that can be used in the Farming Station: Mushroom, and Roach Nest. It takes 10s to produce 1 item. 
        You can produce an infinite amount of both Mushrooms and Roach Nests with them.  </p>
