      <h2>Everytime you die:</h2>
      <p> 
        Whenever you die, you will lose 1 Respawn Life, as well as dropping all your loot. If you are out of Respawn Lifes,
        you can pay credits to respawn again, with the price being TODO. If you can't pay it, then its game over, and you have to 
        finish the revolution. Everytime you respawn, you recieve a Sledgehammer (T1), and a Build Tool. You can, however, choose a
        "Gear Up" package, which cost credits. The list of Gear Up packages are as follows:

      <h2>Barrier Breaking Rewards:</h2>
      <p> Breaking the Barriers in the undercarriages between class 3 and 2 
        and between class 2 and 1 is a great way of progressing through the train.
        The first barrier has a health of 10000, whereas the second barrier
        has a health of 15000. Breaking either will give you 3 common isotopes. 
      </p>

      <h2>Base Building:</h2>
      <p> You can build a base on almost all carriages of the train. To do so, you will require a Build tool.
        With that build tool, you can build, upgrade, repair, and disassemble. In the build section, you can make:
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Foundation</li>
        <li>Wall</li>
        <li>Door</li>
        <li>Window</li>
        <li>Stairs - Up</li>
        <li>Stairs - Down</li>
        <li>Railing</li>
      </ul>

        One important information that everyone should know, is that your base will decay if you do not 
        place a Base Core. Base Cores prevent your base from decaying, however they consume resources. 
        Base extenders add +5 to Base Core Chemicals consumption.

        If you use the build tool to repair a structure, it takes 10 Metal.

      <h2>Farming Station:</h2>
      <p> There are two resources that can be used in the Farming Station: Mushroom, and Roach Nest. It takes 10s to produce 1 item. 
        You can produce an infinite amount of both Mushrooms and Roach Nests with them, however, you have to have at least 1 to
        start the process.</p>
